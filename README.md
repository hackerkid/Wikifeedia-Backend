##Wikipedia turned into a Newsfeed

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia/gh-pages/images/gif.gif)

##How it works?

The home page of Wikifeedia consist of a news feed of Featured articles. Featured articles are considered to be the best articles in Wikipedia. As of now there is no API for getting a list of featured articles that changes each time one make a request. To facilitate this I had to to make a new API server along with some Javascript tweaks.

The frontend of Wikifeedia can be found [here](https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia).
